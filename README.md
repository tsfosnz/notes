# notes

Angular2, Reactjs, Circle.js, Elm, Vue ...

Which one is the best choice?

- Individual intended to choose the one he/she manage to use well.
- The cost of maintenance is one primary reason
- The stablity and realiblity is the second reason, so about community support
- The cost of hiring a experienced developer is key reason 
- The project scale is also the reason

As an individual programmer, like reactjs the best, especially react native.

- It's productive
- Scalable (low cost of maintenance)
- The project will be easier to maintain
- Performance is fine
- Very supportive community with stable version

Anything beyond that espeically keen on how cool the design pattern is, is not practical.

Obviously, Elm is the coolest.

But do you think a team will use it because you are good at it, without thinking how difficult they can find another guys to support the work?

They will never.
